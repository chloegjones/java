I programmed the visualizer Cgjnd7SpaceVisualizer using NetBeans 8.2 IDE. This was probably one of my favorite projects so far! I highly recommend clicking the link.

This project was inspired by my passion for creating equitable spaces. Designed with NetBeans 8.2 IDE. I used the NYT API to pull up recent news articles and embedded youtube videps. I also created multiple scenes you can switch back and forth from. Click the link to view!

This was one of my first Java projects. I was introduced to the Model View Controller software design pattern. Being one of my first challenges, I remember this project being pretty difficult. We had to use a graph, graphics, and timeline keyframe to configure the stopwatch. Some mistakes are in the code, for example, the buttons get messed up after a few clicks. I'm planning on looking back at the project now that school is over and trying to fix those errors.
